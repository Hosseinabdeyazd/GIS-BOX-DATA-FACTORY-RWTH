    "Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts. A variable is used to store data (values). The code below does not have a visual output printed on the screen, because the variable is set with a data type or the data type is assigned to the variable. When writing code, it is important to choose variable names that are meaningful. The last example in the code cell below is an example of what one should not do. The variable name gives no information about the content or meaning in the code. A name of a variable can be almost chosen free, apart from a few words, as they have special meaning such as: if, for, list, try, ... . Variable names can not be just a number or start with a number, but thy can contain numbers: number1 or number_2. "
