    "## What is a graph?\n",
    "Well, before we start, let us talk about what s graph actually is, therefore we need to do some theory.  \n",
    "In general: **A graph represents a set of objects and their relationships (relation).**\n",
    "Components you require for a graph are: **vertex** and **edge**. Using these two elements one can create polygons, corners, etc. Connecting vertexes using edges creates your graph. Additionally, vertexes and edges can have a weight, to provide them a *cost* or a *weight*. This is used when different ways are existing, and you need to figure out what is the best one (for example when calculating the best way to walk from a to b and there are two ways, but one is much longer than the other, or one it less easy to walk than the other, etc.).  \n",

    "<img src=\"./img/graph-basic.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The formal definition**:  \n",
    "A graph G is a pair (V, E) with the following properties:\n",
    "1. V is a finite, non-empty set (elements of this set are called nodes).\n",
    "2. E ⊆ V × V describes the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example algorithms for graph processing and network analysis\n",
    "Well, there are some algorithms to further categorize and process a graph. The algorithms, we present here, are focusing on subgraph identification and processing. So let us start with the first one for identifying a *connected subgraph* within a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connected subgraph algorithm\n",
    "In general, on top of a network data model, more network analysis functions can be implemented. One of them is finding specific subgraphs, such as for example which nodes can be reached starting at a specific point. This subgraph, finding all reachable nodes starting from a specific point, is called *connected subgraph*. The figure below shows reachable nodes starting from node **v2**. As you can see, the node **v6** is **not reachable**.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum spanning tree algorithm\n",
    "Another network analysis operation is finding the *minimum spanning tree*, which is the spanning tree with the minimum sum of edge weights. Take a look at the following figure, each edge has a value here. **a)** is the original graph, **b)** is the minimal spanning tree, because there are not just no cycles left, but adding all costs together is **= 14**, which is the lowest possible value. **c)** is also a spanning tree, but not the minimal one, because all cost values together are 20, which is **> 14**.\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/graph-cost.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortest path algorithm\n",
    "One of the most important network operations is called *shortest path*. Here, the path with the lowest costs between two nodes is calculated. But what means *the lowest costs*? Well, every edge can have a value, this value defines the cost. A value could be the length of an edge, for example. We just used a method for calculating the shortest path between two places, which are (in our graph) represented as points. The method we used is based on the *Dijkstra Algorithm*.  \n",
    "[Dijkstra algorithm](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra-Algorithmus#:~:text=Der%20Algorithmus%20von%20Dijkstra%20(nach,Pfade%20f%C3%BCr%20einen%20gegebenen%20Startknoten.) is better explained watching a video, search for Dijykstra on YouTube, there are a lot of tutorials. When we calculated the shorted path between *Reiff Museum* and *Aachen central station* in the method *.shorted_path()*, we actually use the Dijkstra algorithm.\n",

Therefore, nodes can represent geographic places with specific locations and edges represent connecting paths.
