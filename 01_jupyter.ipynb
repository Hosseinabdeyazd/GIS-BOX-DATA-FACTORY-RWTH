    "Hi there, this Jupyter Notebook is for you to learn interactive basics of Python programming and analysing geospatial data. You are welcome to change, manipulate or add code and keep your notebook running. There are a few exercises distributed over the notebooks for you to deal with. We recommand doing them, as they help you to practise and develop a better understanding. Additionally, they can support your preparation for the final exam. We provided lots of links for you to get further information, but feel free to do research on your own.  \n",
