    "# Open Street Map - *Geometry*\n",
    "Geometry is an important aspect for OSM data, because this is actually something you can get here by using different query strategies.\n",
    "There are 3D OSM geometries, however in this course we only focus on 0D, 1D and 2D geometries, which should be enough content.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us go through them - what is what:\n",
    "- 0-D geometry is a point (represented by a 3-D coordinate (x, y, z))\n",
    "- 1-D geometries are curves or lines (Having a start and an end coordinate)\n",
    "- 2-D geometries (typically called *regions*, *polygons* or *surfaces*) are continuos connected 2-D point sets, delimited by curves (that is why you have to provide the first point of a polygon in GeoJSON again at the end)\n",
    "- 3-D geometries are spatial objects such as buildings, they are not flat any more. Mathematically they are described by rigid bodies (a bounded, regular and semi-analytical subset of $R^3$). There are different schemas to represent solids, however the most common one used in GIS is boundary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though I also mentioned 3-D geometries (for the sake of completeness) we are only looking into points, lines, and polygons. When we use *OSMnx* methods and functions for querying OSM data, take a look at the methods and functions naming, you will see the name already reveals what sort of data we are querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this geometry data we can create nice maps as for example a street network or a figure ground plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we need to import the necessary libraries."
