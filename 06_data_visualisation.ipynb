Next we need a GeoDataFrame (or a DataFrame, but in this example it is a GeoDataFrame). To get one we go ahead and query OSM (using *OSMnx*) for geometries around the Reiff museum which are declared to be buildings within a distance of 100. Finally, we add the geometries to our map as a new layer."
